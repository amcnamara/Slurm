NOTE: Slurm is in ongoing development, many of the features described aren't yet implemented, Slurm is not yet ready for production.  However, I appreciate all feedback, ideas, and patches.

Slurm is a clojure ORM, with some interesting features:
- Eager or lazy loading of database objects
- Loading of database object based on a graph of read/write usage history (smart loading)
- Simple to define schemas, makes for easy adoption on existing projects
- Very expressive DB interface (CRUD and direct access if needed)
- Sequence processing of database records
- Extensive schema verification, ensuring that updates/changes to either the slurm schema or database schema don't fail silently
- Support for server pools, allowing seamless scaling and optimization of schemas if needed

Slurm is in active development, and changing often.  Again, not recommended for production environments -- yet.

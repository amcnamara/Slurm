NOTE: Slurm is in ongoing development, and not yet ready for production.  However, I appreciate all feedback, ideas, and patches.

Slurm is a clojure ORM, with some interesting features:
- Eager or lazy loading (selectable) of database objects
- Seamless single and multi object relations
- Multiple DB connections with different initialization parameters can be maintained
- Simple to define schemas, makes for easy adoption on existing projects/DBs
- Simple, expressive, and safe DB interface (CRUD, with all statements prepared)
- Sequence processing of database records
- Extensive schema verification and logging, ensuring that updates/changes to either the slurm schema or database schema don't fail silently

Slurm is in active development, please check back for updates often.  If you need any help just ping me at alex.mcnamara@dreamux.com.
